Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers . During follow-up , 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer . SIR analyses showed 50 % and 90 % increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC , respectively ( p < 0.01 ) . The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC ( 130 % ) . The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers , but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess : oral , lung , colon , breast , prostate , thyroid , leukemia , lymphoma and central nervous system . Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex , older age , lower residential latitude , being married and low education and income .

Our goal was to assess the carcinogenic risks associated with long-term use of tamoxifen in women with early stage breast cancer . The incidence of new primary cancers among 2729 women participants of the Stockholm Trial was determined at a median follow-up of 9 years . In this trial , after primary surgery , postmenopausal patients aged less than 71 years with unilateral invasive breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen ( 40 mg daily ) or no adjuvant endocrine therapy . Information on second cancers was obtained by retrospective linkage to the Swedish Cancer Registry . To increase statistical power , a joint analysis of the incidence of endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers was performed in the following three major studies in Scandinavia evaluating adjuvant tamoxifen therapy : the Stockholm Trial , the Danish Breast Cancer Group Trial , and the South-Swedish Trial . These studies included a total of 4914 patients with a median follow-up of 8-9 years . All P values were calculated from two-tailed tests of statistical significance . In the Stockholm Trial , there was a statistically significant ( P = .008 ) reduction in the incidence of second primary cancers in the contralateral breast among the tamoxifen-treated patients . However , there was a nearly sixfold increase in endometrial cancers ( P < .001 ) and a threefold increase in gastrointestinal cancers in the tamoxifen-treated patients . The results of the joint studies showed a statistically significant increase in endometrial cancers among the tamoxifen-treated patients ( relative risk [ RR ] = 4.1 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.9-8 .9 ) .

There was no substantial increase in any other type of gastrointestinal cancer ( e.g. , liver cancer ) among the tamoxifen-treated patients . The endometrium and gastrointestinal organs may be target sites for tamoxifen-induced carcinogenesis in humans .

These patients had been randomly assigned to receive 40 mg/d tamoxifen orally for 2 years beginning 4 weeks after surgery for breast cancer . Histologic specimens , patient records , and death certificates were reviewed to verify treatment and causes of death . Thirteen of the 17 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer were alive ; for three of the four who had died , the cause of death was endometrial cancer . All 16 evaluable tumors except one were World Health Organization ( WHO ) histologic grades I-II . Only one patient had advanced disease ( stage IV ) ; the remaining tumor was a mixed mesodermal malignant tumor that could not be classified under the WHO grading system . Median time for adjuvant tamoxifen use was 24 months ( range , 6-60 months ) with a median cumulative tamoxifen dose of 29 g ( range , 7-72 g ) . Median time from initiation of adjuvant tamoxifen to diagnosis of endometrial cancer was 32 months ( range , 6-130 months ) . Ten-year actuarial survival after diagnosis of endometrial cancer for the 17 patients treated with tamoxifen was 73 % . Because of the small number of patients , our results do not rule out the possibility of a favorable prognosis for patients with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer following tamoxifen treatment . The incidence of secondary endometrial cancer reported in this study following treatment of breast cancer patients with tamoxifen at doses of 40 mg/d in a large clinical trial is higher than that reported for previous large trials of tamoxifen at doses of 20 mg/d . Thus , tamoxifen dosage may be a critical factor in the subsequent occurrence of endometrial cancer . Our results also suggest two important considerations for improved follow-up in long-term tamoxifen trials : careful registration of second cancers and routine gynecologic examinations to ensure early detection of endometrial cancer . \"\n","}\n","13 14519752 2.47420\n","{\n","  \"id\" : \"14519752\",\n","  \"contents\" : \"The interval cancer rate is an important parameter for determining the sensitivity of a screening procedure and the screening interval . We evaluated the time and mechanism of detection and the stage distribution of interval prostate cancers diagnosed during a 4-year screening interval . We determined the rate of interval cancers and the sensitivity of the screening protocol ( involving prostate-specific antigen , digital rectal and transrectal ultrasound examinations ) in a cohort of 17 226 men ( 8350 on the screened arm , 8876 on the control arm ) enrolled consecutively on the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer-Rotterdam . Men on the screened arm received a first screen between October 1993 and December 1996 and a scheduled second screen 4 years later . Prostate cancers detected in men enrolled on the control arm over the same 4-year period and , between screens , in men on the screened arm , were identified by linkage to the Dutch national cancer registry . During the first screen , 412 prostate cancers were detected . During the subsequent 4-year period , 135 cancers were diagnosed in men in the control arm and 25 cancers were diagnosed in men in the screened arm . Seven of the 25 cancers were diagnosed in men who had refused a recommended biopsy at their initial screen . Of the remaining 18 cancers , all were classified as stage T1A-C or T2A and none were poorly differentiated or metastatic . The rate of interval cancers relative to the number of cancers in the control group was 18.5 % ( 25/135 ) , or 13.3 % ( 18/135 ) , if the seven who refused an initial biopsy were excluded . The sensitivity of the screening protocol was 79.8 % when considering all 25 interval cancers and 85.5 % when considering 18 interval cancers . The interval cancer rate with a 4-year screening interval was low , confirming that the screening procedure has a high sensitivity and that the 4-year screening interval is reasonable . \"\n","}\n","14 21047591 2.47420\n","{\n","  \"id\" : \"21047591\",\n","  \"contents\" : \"The European randomised study of screening for prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated to evaluate the effect of Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) screening on prostate cancer mortality .

The interval between the first screening rounds was 6 years on average . Interval cancers were defined as cancers diagnosed during the screening interval but not detected by screening . Cases with a positive screening test were considered as interval cancers if diagnosis through biopsy occurred more than 1 year after screening . Interval cancer cases were identified through linkage with cancer registries . Aggressive interval cancer was defined as cancer with at least one of the following characteristics : stage M1 or N1 , Gleason score higher than 7 or World Health Organisation ( WHO ) score of 3 . The 10 year cumulative incidence of interval cancers was 3.0 % ( n = 50 ) and the cumulative incidence of aggressive interval cancers was 0.5 % ( n = 8 ) . During the first screening interval 36 interval cancers were detected . Of these 20 ( 55.6 % ) were detected more than 4 years after the initial screening and 5 ( 13.9 % ) were considered aggressive .

Previous research using SEER-Medicare data to measure incremental costs and utilization associated with cancer started with the date of diagnosis .

Cases were 121,293 persons enrolled between January 2000 and December 2008 with 1 primary cancers . We selected 522,839 controls randomly from among all health plan members who had no tumor registry evidence of cancer before January 2009 , and we frequency matched controls to cancer cases on a 5:1 ratio by age group , sex , and having health plan eligibility in the year of diagnosis of the index cancer case . Utilization data were extracted for all cases and controls for the period 2000 to 2008 from standardized distributed data warehouses . To determine when and the extent to which patterns of medical care use change preceding a cancer diagnosis , we compute hospitalization rates , hospital days , emergency department visits , same-day surgical procedures , ambulatory medical office visits , imaging procedures , laboratory tests , and ambulatory prescription dispensings per 1000 persons per month within integrated delivery systems . One - to 3-fold increases in monthly utilization rates were observed during the 3 to 5 months before a cancer diagnosis , compared with matched noncancer control groups . This pattern was consistent for both aged and nonaged cancer patients . Aged cancer patients had higher utilization rates than nonaged cancer patients throughout the year before a cancer diagnosis . The prediagnosis phase is a resource-intensive component of cancer care episodes and should be included in cost of cancer estimates . More research is needed to determine whether reliable prognostic markers can be identified as the start of a cancer episode before a pathology-based diagnosis . \"\n","}\n","17 12518005 2.47350\n","{\n","  \"id\" : \"12518005\",\n","  \"contents\" : \"It has recently been suggested that all-cause mortality is a more appropriate end point than disease specific mortality in cancer screening trials , and that disease specific mortality is biased in favour of screening . This suggestion is based partly on supposed inconsistencies between all-cause mortality results and disease specific results in cancer screening trials , and alleged increases in deaths from causes other than breast cancer among breast cancer cases diagnosed among women invited to screening . We used data from the Swedish Two-County Trial of mammographic screening for breast cancer , in which 77 080 women were randomised to an invitation to screening and 55 985 to no invitation . We estimated relative risks ( RRs ) ( invited v control ) of death from breast cancer , death from other causes within the breast cancer cases , and death from all causes within the breast cancer cases . RRs were adjusted for age and took account of the longer follow up of breast cancer cases in the invited group due to lead time . There was a significant 31 % reduction in breast cancer mortality in the invited group ( RR 0.69 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.58-0 .80 ; p < 0.001 ) . There was no significant increase in deaths from other causes among breast cancer cases in the invited group ( RR 1.12 , 95 % CI 0.96-1 .31 ; p = 0.14 ) .

These findings are consistent with the magnitude of the reduction in breast cancer mortality . Invitation to screening was associated with a reduction in deaths from all causes among breast cancer cases , consistent with high participation rates in screening . There is no significant evidence of bias in cause of death classification in the Two-County Trial , and as breast cancer mortality is the targeted clinical outcome in breast cancer screening , it is the appropriate end point in a breast cancer screening trial .
